# Welcome to my XPU Notes

This will serve and my notes for setting up and running XPU related projects within PyTorch, Tensorflow, StableDiffusion etc...

I am currently testing with:

ASRock ARC A380 6GB
Acer ARC A770 16GB
Dual GPU with 2x Intel ARC B580 LE 12GB

I am very impressed so far with the Battlemage mixed precision performance. In my benchmarks I am seeing a single B580's performance around an RTX 2080 Ti or Nvidia L4 in Google Colab training a BERT model.

I am far from an expert or engineer, but I do enjoy learning every day.
