# My XPU Benchmarks

**Note** These benchmarks are all in Jupyter Lab Notebook format. However you can simply copy and past the python out to run as a native python file.

All benchmarks have been tested with the following:

- XPU Discreet GPU
  - ARC Battlemage B580 12GB
    - On current drivers I am having issues running Alchemist with Battlemage in dual setup. I will only run the single B580 for now since its shiny and new.
- CPU and RAM
  - 14900K Locked at 5.4ghz/4.1ghz 230w
  - 6800Mhz DDR5
- OS
  - Windows 11
- Environment
  - Python 3.12
  - Use the following to setup the environment
